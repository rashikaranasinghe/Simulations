# Hybrid Zone Simulations

**1. Interactive Hybrid-Zone Triangle Plot**

A small R Shiny app that simulates and visualizes hybridization between two parental populations using a triangular (hybrid index vs. interspecific heterozygosity) plot.
Users can change the number of simulated individuals and the average hybrid index to explore how hybrid and parental samples distribute in the triangle. The app also displays 300 reference points (100 P1, 100 P2, 100 F1-like) for comparison.
